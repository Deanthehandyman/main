I get calls daily from folks around Pittsburg saying, 'Dean, I bought Starlink, set it in the yard, and it drops connection constantly.'</p><p>Starlink satellites move fast across the sky. Your dish needs a wide, clear field of view to track them. If a single pine branch is in that path, the signal gets cut until it finds the next satellite.</p><p>The solution isn't cutting down the forest; it's getting above it. I specialize in high-mount installations. Whether it's a ridge mount on your roof or a pole mount, getting that dish 10 feet higher usually solves the obstruction issue entirely.</p>"

That's not a ghost; that's a loose neutral wire.</p><p>Your electrical system relies on a neutral wire to balance the load. If that connection gets loose at the meter base or in your panel, the voltage goes haywire. This can fry your electronics instantly.</p><p>More importantly, the arcing at the loose connection creates heat that can start a fire in your walls. Do not ignore flickering lights.</p>"
