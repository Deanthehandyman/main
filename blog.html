                body: `<p>Out here in the piney woods, we love our trees, but they are the absolute enemy of satellite internet. I get calls daily from folks around Pittsburg saying, "Dean, I bought Starlink, set it in the yard, and it drops connection constantly."</p><p>Here’s the deal: Starlink isn't like old-school TV satellites that point at one spot. These satellites are flying across the northern sky fast. Your dish needs a wide, clear field of view to track them. If a single pine branch is in that path, the signal gets cut until it finds the next satellite.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628126235206-52605511dc5a?w=800&q=80" alt="Starlink dish on roof"><p>The solution isn't cutting down the forest; it's getting above it. I specialize in high-mount installations. Whether it's a ridge mount on your roof or a pole mount, getting that dish 10 feet higher usually solves the obstruction issue entirely. Don't settle for spotty service when a professional mount can fix it.</p>`

                body: `<p>I had a customer in Mt. Pleasant tell me they thought their house was haunted. Every time the microwave ran, the living room lights would dim, and sometimes the TV would reset. That's not a ghost; that's a loose neutral wire, and it's surprisingly dangerous.</p><p>Your electrical system relies on a "neutral" wire to balance the load and return current to the panel. If that connection gets loose at the meter base or in your breaker box due to heat or age, the voltage in your house goes haywire. Some outlets might drop to 60 volts, while others spike to 180 volts.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1621905251189-08b45d6a269e?w=800&q=80" alt="Electrical panel wiring"><p>This voltage fluctuation will fry sensitive electronics like smart TVs and computers instantly. More importantly, the arcing at the loose connection creates intense heat that can start a fire in your walls. If you notice these symptoms, do not ignore them. This requires a professional electrician to tighten down the main lugs and check the service entrance.</p>`

                body: `<p>We don't get hard winters often, but when that arctic blast hits Pittsburg and drops us into the teens for three days, RVers are the first to suffer. Living full-time in my own rig, I learned the hard way years ago that the thin underbelly of a camper offers almost zero protection for PEX pipes.</p><p>When the wind whips under your rig, it freezes your water lines almost instantly. The easiest and most effective solution is RV skirting. It wraps around the bottom of your camper, creating a dead air space underneath.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1533630793084-85713609a54a?w=800&q=80" alt="RV parked in winter"><p>By trapping the heat that radiates from your floor, you keep the underbelly above freezing. It also drastically cuts down on your propane usage because your furnace isn't fighting the cold wind underneath the floor. Whether you use foam board or custom vinyl skirting, just get it done before the first hard freeze warnings.</p>`

The standard router that comes with Starlink isn't going to punch through your house walls and travel that far reliably.</p><p>The solution is not digging a 200-foot trench for an ethernet cable. The solution is a Wireless Point-to-Point Bridge. Think of it like an invisible ethernet cable carried through the air.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563770660941-20978e870e26?w=800&q=80" alt="Wireless antenna on a pole"><p>We mount small dish on the house and another on the barn, pointing at each other. They create a dedicated, high-speed link just between the two buildings. Once the signal hits the barn, we plug it into a standard Wi-Fi router.

                body: `<p>I was at a job last week and heard a loud popping and rumbling coming from the utility closet. The homeowner said, "Oh yeah, it's been doing that for months." Folks, that is the sound of your water heater begging for help.</p><p>Our water here can have minerals in it. Over time, calcium and sediment settle to the bottom of your tank. When the burner at the bottom turns on to heat the water, that layer of sediment traps steam bubbles underneath it. The popping sound is those steam bubbles violently bursting through the sediment layer.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606214555898-1e43c5b36481?w=800&q=80" alt="Plumbing tools"><p>This buildup insulates the water from the heat source, making your heater work twice as hard and jacking up your energy bill. Eventually, the excessive heat at the bottom will burn out the heating elements or crack the tank liner, leading to a flood. The fix? Flush your water heater tank annually.

If a drill dies in the middle of mounting a Starlink dish on a roof, I'm losing time and money.</p><p>I used cheaper brands when I started. They work fine for weekend warriors, but day-in, day-out professional abuse kills them quickly. The main reason I switched to the DeWalt 20V platform is battery consistency and torque.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1572981779307-38ad25c5ec86?w=800&q=80" alt="Power drill and screws"><p>When I'm drilling through brick to run conduit, I need sustained power that doesn't fade halfway through the job. The XR series batteries hold up to the East Texas heat better than others I've tried.

An owner sees a leak around a vent, runs to the hardware store, grabs a tube of clear household silicone, and slathers it on. It stops the leak... for about three weeks.</p><p>Most RV roofs are made of EPDM or TPO membrane (rubber). Standard silicone does not bond chemically with this material. As soon as the RV flexes down the road or the sun heats it up, the silicone pulls away, creating a new path for water.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536407896971-090636da1289?w=800&q=80" alt="Caulking gun"><p>Worse yet, nothing sticks to old silicone, not even new silicone. To fix it right, I have to spend hours scraping every bit of that old residue off before I can apply the correct product. The only thing you should be using on a flat RV roof is Self-Leveling Lap Sealant (like Dicor). It spreads out, bonds to the rubber, and stays flexible for years.</p>`

I've seen too many DIY jobs where the TV slowly pulled away from the wall because the wrong anchors were used.</p><p>Most TV mounts come with plastic plugs meant for drywall or solid concrete. If you put those in old, crumbly mortar joints, they will eventually slip out under the constant weight of a large TV.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581092921461-eab62e97a783?w=800&q=80" alt="Drilling into a wall"><p>When I mount into masonry, I use Tapcon concrete screws. You have to drill a precise pilot hole with a hammer drill, and then these specialty screws cut their own threads into the brick itself. When done right, I could probably do pull-ups on the mount before the TV is even attached. It's the only way to ensure your expensive new TV doesn't end up on the hearth.</p>`

                body: `<p>Before Starlink, rural gaming out here was impossible. HughesNet has awful latency (ping), making online shooters unplayable. When I install Starlink for a family, the first question from the teenagers is always, "Can I game on it?"</p><p>As someone who enjoys hopping on Xbox in the evenings, I can tell you: Yes, absolutely. *But* there is a catch. In the Pittsburg area, I typically see latency between 30ms and 50ms. That is perfectly fine for competitive gaming.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1548348425-9f5b2b2b2f56?w=800&q=80" alt="Gaming setup with controller"><p>The catch is obstructions. If you have a tree branch that blocks the signal for just 2 seconds every minute, you will experience "rubber-banding" and lag spikes that will get you killed in-game. For gamers, a perfectly clear view of the sky is non-negotiable. That's why getting the professional roof mount is critical if you care about online play.</p>`

They are flimsy, hard to turn, and if you are carrying a cooler or fishing gear back from the lake, fumbling for them is a pain.</p><p>One of the most popular upgrades I do for RVers out at Lake Bob Sandlin is installing keyless entry handles. It's a direct replacement for your standard latch. You just punch in a 4-digit code, and the deadbolt opens electrically.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1623780350327-c342196a4486?w=800&q=80" alt="RV Door latch"><p>It's great for families because the kids don't need to carry keys to get back inside.

Nine times out of ten, it's a tripped GFCI breaker caused by moisture.</p><p>By code, outdoor outlets must be GFCI protected. They are designed to cut power instantly if electricity leaks where it shouldn't—like into water. Over time, the plastic "bubble covers" over your outdoor plugs get brittle in the Texas sun. They crack, or the foam gasket on the back dries up and fails.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581147036324-c17ac41dfa6c?w=800&q=80" alt="Electrician working on outlet"><p>When rain hits the wall, it runs right inside the box, trips the GFCI, and sometimes kills the outlet entirely.

For permanent roof installs, this is actually better because it's fewer moving parts to break in high winds.</p><p>But the real upgrade is the router. The Gen 2 router was okay for small homes, but it struggled to push Wi-Fi through brick walls or to the far bedrooms of larger ranch houses.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1628126235206-52605511dc5a?w=800&q=80" alt="Starlink Setup"><p>The Gen 3 router uses WiFi 6 technology and has much better range and speed capability. More importantly, it finally has two built-in Ethernet ports, so you don't have to buy that silly adapter dongle anymore. If you have a larger home and are ordering new, Gen 3 is the way to go.</p>`

Many homeowners try to slap some spackle over it, and it ends up looking like a mounted blister on the wall forever.</p><p>For holes up to about 4 inches, I use what's called a "California Patch" (or hot patch). You cut a piece of drywall slightly larger than the hole, but you cut the back paper off, leaving the front paper intact to act as tape.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1621905252507-b35492cc74b4?w=800&q=80" alt="Painting a wall"><p>Using "hot mud" (quick-setting joint compound), you set that patch flush with the wall. It bonds tighter and dries faster than standard spackle. After two thin skim coats and a light sanding, once it's painted, you’ll never know it happened. The trick is thin coats and patience.</p>`
